#### Explanation
Some sites and services restrict some zero width characters so saving the zero width may be an issue. To get around this, certain limited algorithms have been created which avoid using the restricted characters.

#### List
Version 1.2 is the current default algorithm. It supports Cyrillic characters (exp. русский) & Hiragana (exp. ひらがな), and is signed with the version number so it can be automatically detected and de-obfuscated on the screen.

Limited proT is compatible with ProtonMail.

Limited twiT is compatible with Twitter & Medium.com

Limited winT is compatible with windows .txt files. 

-----------------------------------------

If 1.2 is not compatible with a site not mentioned here, try using the limited versions and report back so the list can be updated.
