#### Explanation
Some sites and services restrict some zero width characters so saving the zero width may be an issue. To get around this, certain special limited algorithms have been created which avoid using the restricted characters.

#### List
Version 1.1 is the current defualt algorithm. It is the most complete in terms of supported characters. It should be supported by majority of services. It was designed to be slightly more efficient than 1.0 in terms of storage size.

Limited proT is compatible with ProtonMail.

Limited twiT is compatible with Twitter. 

Limited winT is compatible with windows .txt files. 

-----------------------------------------

If 1.1 is not compatible with a site not mentioned here, try using the limited versions and report back so the list can be updated.
