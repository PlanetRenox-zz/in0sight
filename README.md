The extension is able to obfuscate as much information as it can take. You can hide entire PGP messages inside version 1. 
Versions 2.0 and 2.1 are a lot more limited. They offer compatibility for sites like Twitter and Protonmail.

###### Some sites use zero width characters in their ui functionality and that will set off the 10sec notice. This is a known issue and we will try to narrow it down in the future.

The current roadmap for the next update currently includes reworking the 10 second notice, introducing a much more efficient algorithm to reduce storage size in case of obfuscating larger chunks of text, having the extension auto detect the version, and a completely seperate java client to be run in a desktop enviroment for windows, mac, and linux. And when the more minor details are stable, introduce password encryption on top of the zero width obfuscation.

Contributors are welcome to help improve/expand the project. Also willing to assign a co-dev position if the vision is there. This being a 100% solo project, finding the time is difficult since I am also working on other projects/school. No matter how minor the pull request, you will be credited. 

Next update is planned for December 2018.

###### It should also be mentioned that if the zero width is inserted using javascript after the page loads, it will not be detected. This is preferred so the addon doesn't use too many resources. If your threat level is that high, using NoScript is recommended.
