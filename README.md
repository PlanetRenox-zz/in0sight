This extension is able to detect and obfuscate any message inside zero width spaces which can be placed almost anywhere invisible to the naked eye. Giving you the ability to communicate hidden in plain sight. 

There is no limit in text length or size. Some websites or services may restrict some zero width characters, however more limited algorithms have been added to get around them. You can view them [here](https://github.com/PlanetRenox/in0sight/blob/master/CompatibilityList.md).

If you come across any bugs or questions submit them to the issues tab or contact planetrenox@pm.me

###### Recently update 1.1 has been released which improved the storage/size efficiency and addressed many common bugs. While introducing new limited algorithms.

* Firefox: [Download](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/in0sight/)
* Chrome: Soonâ„¢
